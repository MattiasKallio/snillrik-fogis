# snillrik-fogis
Wordpress plugin for displaying soccer info from Fogis using generated shortcodes.

## How to use
It's not very well documented just right now. But the basic idea is to generate shortcodes under the Fogis settings-page by selecting teams etc. 
Then use the shortcodes on pages or in widgets or where ever. :)

## How official is this pluign?
Not at frikken all. I got a request from a football club that wanted some of this functionallity, and discovered that it's possible to make API calls. 
I'm not sure if it's intended to be used this way, but it might be turned off or blocket from external use. (But also it have been working for 3 years according to people I've talked to)
